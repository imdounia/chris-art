Add Stripe payment gateway to your WooCommerce store to accept payments via credit, debit cards, Alipay, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.

== Description ==

= Introduction =
Do you want to accept Credit cards, Debit cards, Alipay, Apple Pay & Google pay on your website? Our Stripe Payment Gateway Plugin for WooCommerce lets you accept payments from multiple channels directly on your website via the Stripe Payment Gateway.

With this plugin, your customer can use their credit/debit cards during the checkout process and Stripe.com handles the rest. This means a smoother experience for your users as they never have to leave your website for making payments.

What else? A unique and intuitive stripe overview page will provide you a consolidated overview of Stripe Payments, where you can do one click capture and refund of payments.

Integrating the Stripe Payment Gateway in your WooCommerce store would be the best way to enable a smooth payment flow for your customers and business.

For guidance on the installation and setup of the plugin, refer to the [plugin documentation](https://www.webtoffee.com/woocommerce-stripe-payment-gateway-plugin-user-guide/).
